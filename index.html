            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>If you've ever wondered what it would be like to live in your favorite roguelike game, this story was made for you.</p>
            <p>I began my journey with this story looking for a fun, turn-off-the-brain fantasy RPG romp, but what I found instead was infinitely better. Our protagonist is thrust into a world where every step he takes is at risk of ensnaring him in a trap, and the first few chapters of the story show you exactly that.</p>
            <p>You'll still find those moments of light-hearted humor and deadpan warps of genre tropes, don't get me wrong. But surrounding them will be political intrigue, a rich hard-magic system, heartbreak and heartbreakers, and more. You'll never be left bored!</p>

            <h2>Should you start with the comic or the novel?</h2>
            <p>I read through what was availabe of the comic--up to around episode 30--and had a great time with it. The art is about average for your big-budget studios--nothing spectacular, but nothing to scoff at either. But the character dynamics and the moments of hilarity really shine through with the artstyle.
            <p>I quickly switched over to the novel, however, because I couldn't stand the wait and the killer cliffhanger. There you'll find an even more in-depth exploration of the world and the characters you'll come to love. Unlike many authors who are churning out LitRPG plots because it's what's "in" right now, the author clearly thought through how each little detail would connect back and tie the world together. It's masterful on the level of other greats like the married author pair who wrote Book Z, authors AB.</p>
            <p>In short, my vote is for the novel. If you're more of a comic stan, you won't be disappointed, and I suspect the art will only get better and better as the story earns its studio more funds, based on the publishing trends I've seen from its source language publishers, 1 and 2.</p>

            <h2>Last Words</h2>
            <p>Hoh, boy, have I got a lot left more to say about this story. I haven't even touched any major plot points. yet I could go on and on about this story.</p>
            <p>Seriously, read this book. Read the manhwa. However you prefer, if you love to game, this story is for you. So much thought and care has been put into this world, its characters, and how you will relate to them.</p>
            <p>It's a story begging to be read, and I'm begging you to read it.</p>
